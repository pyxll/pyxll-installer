This whole file can be removed if not required.
It is here as an example of some simple UI appearance changes.

This Localization item is used to over-ride the standard "LicenseAgreementDlgDescription" message.

The Ids for all the messages can be found in, for example, the WixUI_en-us.wxl file in the WiX source
